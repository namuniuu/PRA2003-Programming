Bacterial Movement and Population Analysis
Scenario

Each input file is a simulated output from a bacterial tracking experiment, modeling how different bacterial species move and proliferate under a given nutrient or stress condition.

**Header**

event ID: ID of the experiment/simulation run
number of bacteria tracked: total number of bacterial cells observed

**Each row after the header**

3D momentum components (px, py, pz, in units of 10⁻²⁰ kg·m/s)
an integer ID for the bacterial strain/genetic variant
Goal

Answer the following:

What are the average counts of each bacterial strain and their statistical uncertainties?
Is there any asymmetry between the normal and the mutant strain?
Is there any asymmetry as a function of their momentum?

**Installation**
bash
# TODO: (list dependencies)
pip install numpy matplotlib
Usage
bash
# TODO: (replaced with actual command)
python analysis.py <input_file>

Output: TODO describe what the script prints/plots (e.g. strain counts + uncertainties, asymmetry value, momentum plot).
